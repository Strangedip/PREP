3. **Teach Others** - Explaining concepts solidifies your understanding
4. **Iterate and Improve** - Come back to problems with fresh perspective
5. **Stay Curious** - Ask "why" and "how" beyond just "what"

### **🔄 When to Move Forward**
Move to the next topic only when you can:
- [ ] Solve 80% of problems in current topic independently
- [ ] Explain the core concepts to someone else
- [ ] Identify the pattern in new, similar problems
- [ ] Apply the concept to solve variations
- [ ] Connect the topic to real-world applications
