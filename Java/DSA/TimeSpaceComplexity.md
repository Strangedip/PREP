#### time complexity is the function which describes the relation between input and time
#### it show the growth rate of time of an algorithm with respect to input
#### there are 3 important notations for time complexity
1. Big O notation O() (Upper bound) (Worst case) lies<infinity
2. Big Omega notation (Lower bound) (minimum time) lies>0
3. theta notation (O + omega) 0<theta<infinity
