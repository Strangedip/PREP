# Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters

## Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the length of the longest substring of `s` that contains at most `k` distinct characters.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring is "ece" with length 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring is "aa" with length 2.
```

## Solution Approach

### Algorithm: Sliding Window
The key insight is to use a sliding window approach with two pointers:

1. **Expand**: Move the right pointer to include more characters
2. **Contract**: When we have more than k distinct characters, move the left pointer
3. **Track**: Keep track of character frequencies and the maximum window size

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. Use a HashMap to count character frequencies in the current window
2. Expand the window by moving the right pointer
3. If distinct characters exceed k, shrink from left until we have â‰¤ k distinct characters
4. Update the maximum length found so far

### Time & Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - Each character is visited at most twice
- **Space Complexity**: O(k) - HashMap stores at most k distinct characters

## Key Insights:
- **Sliding Window Pattern**: Classic two-pointer technique
- **Character Frequency Tracking**: Use HashMap or array for frequency counting
- **Window Validation**: Maintain exactly k or fewer distinct characters
- **Optimization**: For ASCII characters, use array instead of HashMap

## Edge Cases:
- Empty string or k = 0
- String length less than k
- All characters are the same
- k is greater than number of distinct characters

## Common Mistakes:
- Forgetting to remove characters with zero frequency from HashMap
- Not handling the case when k = 0
- Incorrect window size calculation
